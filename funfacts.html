    <h3>Who is Alcremie, anyway?</h3>

    <div class="one-value">
    <ul>
      <li>Alcremie is a pokémon introduced in the 8th generation (Sword and Shield era). </li>
      <li>It is a pure fairy type pokémon and evolves from Milcery.</li>
      <li> Typcially, you can find a Milcery in yellowed patches of grass.</li></ul>
    </div>

    <h3> How do you get one?</h3>

    <div class="one-value">
    <p> The process of getting an Alcremie isn't as simple as levelling it up. She's just quirky like that.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="right-column" class="list">
    <ol>
      <li>Catch a Milcery in yellow grass</li>
      <li>Gain a sweet (either a strawberry, berry, clover, flower, ribbon, star or love sweet) from the Battle Cafés dotted around Galar.</li>
      <li>Make your Milcery hold the sweet as a held item.</li>
      <li>Make your character spin around in the overworld for at least 5-10 seconds.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>And voila, you have an Alcremie!</p>

    <h3>How many different kinds are there?</h3>

    <div class="one-value">
    <p>There are many different colours of alcremie, all depending on how long you spin, which direction you spin,
        the time of day... better get collecting!</p>
